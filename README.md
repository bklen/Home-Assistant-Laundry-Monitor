# Home-Assistant-Laundry-Monitor
Home Assistant Laundry monitor for washers and dryers that don't have "smart/IOT" features.

This custom monitor utilizes an energy/power meter, a magnetic door contact sensor, and a vibration sensor(SW-420). The monitor reports the laundry status through Home Assistant and sends phone notification reminders to move clothes from the washer to the dryer.

  * Power Meter: Monitors washer machine status (running or off)  
  * Magnetic door contact sensor: This is for checking that the clothes get unloaded and moved to the dryer. Sends a phone notification reminder every X minutes, waits to send a notification if dryer is running  
  * Vibration Sensor: Monitors dryer status (running or off)

  * [Micro USB Wall Charger 5V 2A](https://a.co/d/495GQlT)
     * Alternatively you can power the esp32 by providing power to the 3.3V(regulated) or 5V(unregulated 5V - 12V) + GND Pin
        * CAUTION: powering the 3.3V pin bypasses the voltage regulator. DO NOT exceed the 3.3V limit!
        * NEVER power an esp32 with a combination of those options at the same time.  
          For example: do not power your ESP32 dev kit via the 5V pin using a 10V input, while at the same time having the module connected to your computer via USB. This will damage your module, and potentially even your computer.

## Step 1: Wire Prototype + Flash ESP32 with ESPHome
[ESP32 Basic Pinout](https://github.com/AchimPieters/esp32-homekit-camera/blob/master/Images/ESP32-38%20PIN-DEVBOARD.png) (38 Pin)  
[ESP32 Detailed Pinout](https://esphome.io/devices/nodemcu_esp32.html)

  3. Compile and upload laundry-room-monitor.yaml to esp32 using ESPHome
  ```YAML
  esphome:
    name: laundry-room-monitor
    friendly_name: laundry_room_monitor
  
  esp32:
    board: nodemcu-32s
    framework:
      type: arduino
  
  # Enable logging

  wifi:
    ssid: !secret wifi_ssid
    password: !secret wifi_password

   # Enable fallback hotspot (captive portal) in case wifi connection fails
  ap:
    ssid: "network-id"
    password: "network-password"

  captive_portal:

  # Sensors that the ESPhome unit is capable of reporting

      name: "laundry_room_monitor WiFi Signal"
      update_interval: 60s
    - platform: uptime

        mode: INPUT_PULLUP
      device_class: door
    - platform: gpio  
      name: "dryer vibration"  
      pin:

  ```
  ![esphome_node](https://github.com/bklen/Home-Assistant-Laundry-Monitor/assets/6707864/533e1936-4d9f-4461-a475-84365501d405)

  4. After flashing and adding the node to ESPHome, verify that the connected sensors change/update the states correctly.
  ![esphome_node2](https://github.com/bklen/Home-Assistant-Laundry-Monitor/assets/6707864/3144b766-90d3-413b-987c-52208d9101fc)
  ![dash-edit-1](https://github.com/bklen/Home-Assistant-Laundry-Monitor/assets/6707864/7217d878-c956-4222-b44a-c5e24e4e3b22)

## Step 2: Add Power/Energy Meter to Home Assistant
  1. Configure/Add power meter to Home Assistant  
  Zigbee Example:
  ![zigbee](https://github.com/bklen/Home-Assistant-Laundry-Monitor/assets/6707864/d9b53256-dcdf-4b81-9cd4-62760f90b5d5)
  2. With the power meter added, we will use it to create a binary sensor [Template](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/template/).  
     The created binary sensor entity has 2 states: "Running" if power is > 5W, and "Not running" when power <= 5W. This will allow us to track the washer status on our dashboard, rather than the washer power usage data.
     ![dash-edit-3](https://github.com/bklen/Home-Assistant-Laundry-Monitor/assets/6707864/f9fab48d-72b0-4341-924a-0276199f3210)
     Edit your configuration.yaml to add the binary sensor template.
     ``` YAML
     template:
      - binary_sensor:
          - name: Washer Status
            device_class: running
            state: "{{ states('sensor.washing_machine_zigbee_power') > '5'}}"
            icon: "mdi:washing-machine"
      ```

## Step 3: Create Automation with Node-RED

```

## Step 4: Assemble Device
  1. Cut the perfboard to fit into the project box.  
     Cut the 2.54mm Headers to fit the ESP32
  ![step1](https://github.com/bklen/Home-Assistant-Laundry-Monitor/assets/6707864/141f17d1-c9a5-4592-8843-09d700fbb5e4)
  ![step2](https://github.com/bklen/Home-Assistant-Laundry-Monitor/assets/6707864/2c69a12f-e469-401a-ae8b-2123fc1424bb)
  2. Solder the headers to the perfboard
  ![step3](https://github.com/bklen/Home-Assistant-Laundry-Monitor/assets/6707864/3a15494c-87e5-453c-b9b1-27350056f611)
  3. Solder on the JST-PH connectors and complete the circuit with solder bridges
  ![step4](https://github.com/bklen/Home-Assistant-Laundry-Monitor/assets/6707864/cb652003-02d4-4bd0-ae53-565ecac1181d)
  ![step4-2](https://github.com/bklen/Home-Assistant-Laundry-Monitor/assets/6707864/45d9163b-e367-4f25-b27b-be65a87ac7b5)
  4. Cut 5x 28 AWG stranded wires. These will be the wires that attach to the vibration sensor and magnetic door contact sensor.  
     Crimp the wires and attach the JST-PH connectors.
     ![crimp_final1](https://github.com/bklen/Home-Assistant-Laundry-Monitor/assets/6707864/75aff8b2-d64f-40d1-8ab0-73b025eda494)

  5. **Before** soldering on vibration sensor:  
     Slide on heat shrink tubing over the wires:
       * 1 tube for each individual wire(x3)
       * OPTIONAL: small tubes over all 3 wires
     
     Solder on vibration sensor.
     ![vibration-1](https://github.com/bklen/Home-Assistant-Laundry-Monitor/assets/6707864/589da7ab-21d0-4f99-b41e-bdbc44acdccb)

  6. Repeat the process for the magnetic door contact sensor
     ![contact-sens](https://github.com/bklen/Home-Assistant-Laundry-Monitor/assets/6707864/24ee4f82-b336-4ef5-8e3c-d0f753e06b03)
  7. Optional: Use black nail polish to dim/cover red power  LED
     * Note: the red power LED on ESP32 devboards are hard-wired and can't be disabled
     * [ESP32 Schematic](https://dl.espressif.com/dl/schematics/esp32_devkitc_v4-sch.pdf) <- red LED is connected directly to the Power rail
     ![black_nail](https://github.com/bklen/Home-Assistant-Laundry-Monitor/assets/6707864/870891e1-6595-4bc5-acd8-32849b35b015)
  8. Finish assembling the device!  
     Cut the project boxes to fit the wires.  
     Attach the vibration sensor to the box with a command strip.
     ![finish-1](https://github.com/bklen/Home-Assistant-Laundry-Monitor/assets/6707864/6463027e-fb6d-447b-83db-bd3002579c2b)
